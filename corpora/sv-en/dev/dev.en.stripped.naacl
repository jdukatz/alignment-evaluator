 Madam President , on a point of order . 
 The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission . 
 We have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February . 
 Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and can not , object to that . 
 All_the_same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety . 
 This , however , does not seem feasible . 
 I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully . 
 My third point has also been mentioned already . 
 Hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation . 
 What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level . 
 However , I feel that we should be a_little_more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy . 
 We shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms . 
 Unemployment is currently at 24_% in 25 of the weakest regions . 
 After all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at_least 3_% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all . 
 Finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries . 
 We must give them this opportunity . 
 In this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance . 
 Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point . 
 I should also like to make a_few comments , firstly , Mr Berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report . 
 You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike . 
 At the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue . 
 Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting . 
 In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together . 
 On the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers . 
 President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism . 
 But , as I have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness . 
 We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies . 
 Fifthly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game . 
 A reform of this point was therefore also necessary . 
 The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762 . 
 But all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market . 
 We therefore await , and I await , the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter . 
 The Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing . 
 Not to save jobs . 
 This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities . 
 The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets . 
 This is therefore an aspect to be considered . 
 The purpose of publishing the White Paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as_well_as from other sources . 
 We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business . 
 The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency . 
 The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly . 
 We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people . 
 Whatever we may say about the European elections , the low turnout is a fact . 
 All this would be established by two regulations , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code . 
 On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools . 
 There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted . 
 There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date . 
 Nothing has changed there . 
 ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
 Until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations . 
 This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country can not be overcome unless there is key integration between national , European and local funding . 
 Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law . 
 Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe . 
 Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity . 
 This aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13_% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8_% to 2.6_% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) . 
 For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission ' s response to our requests and demands . 
 The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast . 
 Nevertheless , perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we need to do more . 
 The world average is around 15.6 incidences in inspections carried out in European ports . 
 In_order_to strengthen controls , we will amend the existing directives on classification companies , the control of ships in ports and the frequency of inspections , relating them to the age and flag of the ship . 
 The time for resolutions has passed . 
 With every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick , sticky , black tar . 
 " It is , of_course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport . 
 We should be aware , for_example , that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil . 
 I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities . 
 Secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely . 
 First of all , the port-state control , according_to which 25_% of all ships require inspection . 
 We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union ' s ports , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor . 
 I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion . 
 In these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage . 
 However , we must stick to the facts . 
 It always came from the Member States , from the Council of Ministers , where they fought doggedly over every trifling matter , achieving very little in terms of progress . 
 I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues . 
 Storms in Europe 
 This is why I would like to thank all of those who gave a hand to the emergency services , and to the authorities and public services which were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task . 
 Firstly because we now know that the occurrence of this kind of climatic phenomenon is never entirely unpredictable . 
 They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens . 
 We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union . That , however , is another problem altogether . 
 Finally , it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood , in_order_to give priority to the purchase of windfalls . 
 So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished . 
 We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it . 
 Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries . 
 The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world . 
 The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments . 
 We must also ensure excellence and transparency . 
 We have made a_lot_of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis . 
 However , the Commission believes that we must go further . 
 I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States . 
 The new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation . 
 The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead . 
 The final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ? 
 I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ? 
 It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out . 
 In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue . 
 It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling . 
 On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner , and his statement . 
 As you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session . 
 Question No_29 by ( H-0786 / 99 ) : 
 Of_course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information . 
 I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world . 
 I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it . 
 As you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated . 
 The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach . 
 Which Commissioners are members of this group ? 
 The contribution commitment is 80_% , rising to an 85_% contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote Greek islands , and a contribution by Greece of 15_% . 
 Question No_40 by ( H-0808 / 99 ) : 
 In other words , it is positive discrimination . 
 Question No_42 by ( H-0817 / 99 ) : 
 There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to . 
 Nevertheless , it has to be said that these will cost the Commission relatively little . 
 We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions . 
 This also applies to whistle-blowers . 
 Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan ' s very expert work on this report . 
 The report is very ambitious . 
 I would like , Mrs van der Laan , to congratulate you on what is indeed a very ambitious report . 
 Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong . 
 I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so_far . 
 We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal . 
 This is worth a compliment although I regret , of_course , that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue . 
 It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late . 
 How should we deal with this ? 
 I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report . 
 When I read Mr van Hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a_lot_of hot air . 
 I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament . 
 Secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement . 
 Mr President , ever_since Plato ' s ' Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts . 
 The concept of transparency stands out in the report . 
 We must win back their faith in EU politics . 
 The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April . 
 Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months . 
 A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change . 
 I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents . 
 I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament . 
 Secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology . 
 It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace . 
 A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements . 
 There are still , needless to say , many unresolved problems and unanswered questions , also involving the Palestinians . 
 This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism , which of_course is completely incorrect . 
 Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability . 
 His behaviour towards Prime_Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting . 
 I consider this to be very encouraging news . 
 The Commission , like Parliament , is a supranational institution of the Union , and for that very reason it has no bilateral diplomatic relations with the Member States . 
 European history has been punctuated over the centuries by an unremitting sequence of wars and conflicts . 
 ( Applause ) 
 That may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we Liberal Democrats had with the Austrian FPÖ in our Liberal International family . 
 ( Applause ) 
 Madam President , the events taking place today in Austria are extremely serious . 
 ( Applause ) 
 Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe . 
 However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties , ... 
 ( Applause ) 
 Our answer to this crucial question is no . 
 Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ? 
 We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour . 
 It is also a matter of conviction . 
 And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning . 
 I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it . 
 The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed . 
 It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of_course also when it comes to human health . 
 This is part of risk management . 
 You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier . 
 I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle . 
 As I have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as_to how this is to be understood . 
 It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases . 
 I can not forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one can not perhaps imagine using it , namely when I was on a visit to Africa . 
 We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication . 
 Mr President , I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts . 
 We must be aware that we face a ratification process which will take around two years and that it is crucial that we guarantee its success . 
 We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th . 
 There is time . 
 A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda . 
 I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward . 
 My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent . 
 That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
 The Finance_Ministers behave as_if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on . 
 Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement . 
 On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 . 
 I think that , under the present rules of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation . 
 I will mention two point that may create tension . 
 One is the balance which has so_far been maintained between large and small countries . 
 Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist . 
 Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened . 
 I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions . 
 Finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in_order_to popularise the topics of these negotiations . 
 These are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain . 
 Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as_well_as the amended version . 
 Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one_or_more Member States . 
 Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers . 
 We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC . 
 There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive . 
 If there is to be a change to the present United_Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United_Kingdom Government and the United_Kingdom Parliament and not en_passant by the European legislative process . 
 For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals . 
 There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory . 
 Behind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system . 
 Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references . 
 The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning . 
 This contrasts most unfavourably with the United_Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United_Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable . 
 The vote will take place at 11_a.m. tomorrow . 
 He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives . 
 Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state . 
 From that point of view , the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest . 
 However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process . 
 I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future . 
 Every single day there are attacks on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians . 
 We need more police officers , as we have nowhere_near enough . 
 Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement . 
 The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy . 
 Since the current programme finished at the end of last year and the Council did not accept the amendments adopted by Parliament , the conciliation procedure had to come into play . 
 It is quite amazing as_to how doggedly the Member States in the Council tried to fight this programme for alternative energies and an appropriate level of funding . 
 We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy . 
 Mr President , Mr Langen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme . 
 In fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives . 
 I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form . 
 The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a_lot_of progress there . 
 I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget . 
 Thank you , Commissioner . 
 CULTURE 2000 
 Congratulations ! 
 I would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above_all , unwanted . 
 We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat . 
 I believe and hope that , despite the assault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status . 
 We want a colourful Europe . 
 Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out . 
 The vote will take place at 11_a.m. tomorrow . 
 I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective . 
 This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol , is the important factor . 
 And what about vehicles which are already on the road ? 
 Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive . 
 We , the Green Group , by_and_large support the common position . 
 We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area . 
 Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life . 
 Having said that , one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12 , i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force . 
 It is high time that we reached an agreement . 
 Most of the technical issues have been resolved . 
 The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint . 
 It sets in stone one particular model of recycling . 
 This is a big problem in my opinion . 
 If you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free . 
 The car industry - and Belgium produces a_great_many cars - did not have any problem with that . 
 Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses , because they managed to recycle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive . 
 Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate . 
 No , of_course not . 
 It is quite the opposite . 
 However , we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency . 
 I regret the confusion which arose recently due_to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used , so creating uncertainty about the Commission ' s attitude to the issue . 
 It should not be in the amendment . 
 And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently . 
 Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved . 
 It is not a quota ! 
 Madam President , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles . 
 On the contrary , we must adopt crystal-clear texts in_order_to limit legal disputes . 
 There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution . 
 The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties . 
 Or their Socialist back-up troops who , in this House , have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats ? 
 The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 . 
 This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe . 
 This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic . 
 Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line , and I supported Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as_well_as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group . 
 I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights . 
 I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned . 
 They will look into the matter thoroughly . 
 Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long_ago other members of his party , the French Communist mayors , were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France . 
 I am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents . 
 Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative 
 It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union . 
 All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity . 
 The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability . 
 I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . 
 The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators . 
 A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities . 
 The reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . 
 We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible . 
 That is a question of solidarity and progress . 
 The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme . 
 Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas . 
 The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each_other . 
 But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside . 
 The investment needs to be visionary . 
 Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III . 
 The European Union is the single largest contributor , with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland . 
 All_in_all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process . 
 We have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation . 
 My group will not be supporting those amendments . 
 In this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds . 
 Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important , that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme . 
 In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU . 
 The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices . 
 Therefore I am putting forward three amendments . 
 A second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes . 
 There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000 . 
 The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2_% of the LEADER budget . 
 This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs . 
 Mr Corbett , I have not received any notification . 
 There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process . 
 Seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a segregation , more mutual enrichment than separation . 
 We support that . 
 The challenge of enlargement is political . 
 We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " them and us " . 
 We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states . 
 On south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements . 
 The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring . 
 My second criticism follows on from the first . 
 The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government . 
 That requires from the Commission , with a view to subsidiarity , concrete plans which we would like to see implemented in the forthcoming programmes . 
 ( Applause ) 
 It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves . 
 That will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions . 
 This is what the Commission will be judged on . 
 Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart . 
 Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic . 
 The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets . 
 I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy . 
 First : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways . 
 Commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy . 
 Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community . 
 I do not necessarily mean financial resources . 
 That foundation is clearly the single market . 
 I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses . 
 No , it does not ! 
 Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about . 
 The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change . 
 Mr President of the Commission , this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission . 
 Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office . 
 Madam President , the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities . 
 At the moment , social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy . 
 Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect . 
 That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place . 
 On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament . 
 If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ? 
 Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status , whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution . 
 The Left ' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER + , the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG , but not URBAN . 
 As an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest . 
 Between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006 . 
 However , Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats . 
 Amendment No_12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of this House . 
 Responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice . 
 We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health , particularly in the case of small children . 
 We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long_since been forgotten . 
 Such a serious issue can not be limited to a technical debate , even_though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters . 
 The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined . 
 I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region . 
 It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality . 
 Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in_order_to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this . 
 Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report . 
 Five amendments have been presented by Parliament . 
 Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product . 
 That is , without_doubt , too short , too sweet and too little . 
 The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30_a.m . 
 It is important for us to remember that this is a framework . 
 The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak . 
 As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals . 
 We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive . 
 Mr President , every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the abundance of water is an illusion . 
 I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail . 
 Needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding . 
 The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter . 
 No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position . 
 Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal . 
 Tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children . 
 What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers . 
 This morning , in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions . 
 The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad_hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership . 
 We want to encourage debate among the people . 
 I will therefore be available whenever you want in_order_to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year . 
 Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and Internet ? 
 I have already appeared before the French Senate . 
 Can such matters be controlled from Brussels ? 
 Do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki ? 
 We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions . 
 However , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population . 
 I have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there . 
 Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ? 
 We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up . 
 Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union . 
 Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting . 
 These are significant texts , adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty , which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race , ethnic origin , sex etc . 
 The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems . 
 Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field ? 
 In 1988 , the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men . 
 This is a crucial goal . 
 Quite simply there is no question of this . 
 I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point . 
 And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland . 
 It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible . 
 A number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , archives , a canteen and furniture . 
 As such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described . 
 Thank you for your reply . 
 The question is then , of_course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ? 
 My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right_now , but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks . 
 Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing . 
 Furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas . 
 A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for_example , is hardly acceptable . 
 The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 . 
 Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office . 
 Firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important arguments . 
 As I said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character . 
 The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water . 
 And , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop . 
 There is no other such policy . 
 Four , to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee , at_least one Member per political group . 
 However , I would like to insist on certain points . 
 Firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I am not questioning . 
 In the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed . 
 These are : to make the systems employment-friendly ; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high-quality health and medical care . 
 There , it is mainstreaming which applies . 
 The challenges are different . 
 If it is not adopted , Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past . 
 It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda . 
 But convergence should be about goals , not means . 
 I can support the report , but there are a_few points which are not completely to my taste . 
 I am certain that most of them would vote for another party next time . 
 But under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated . 
 With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection . 
 The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria , which would be binding and of real effect . 
 The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences . 
 The labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules . 
 It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works . 
 We can only say yes_or_no to the agreement as it stands . Yes_or_no to an agreement which contains deficiencies . 
 This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy . In this connection , I expect our three institutions , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , to be in agreement . 
 The debate is closed . 
 Mr President , I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda . 
 There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy . 
 The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy . 
 We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies . 
 This is a real innovation , both in the EU / ACP context and in international relations in general . 
 This is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances . 
 We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned . 
 It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves . 
 This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action . 
 Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson . 
 This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade . 
 Nevertheless , I ask myself what moral right or claim we have to do so , when the necessary criteria , those of democracy and rule of law , are taking a_few knocks themselves in the EU Member States ? 
 Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ? 
 We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them . 
 The Commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission . 
 There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain . 
 Are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ? 
 Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent . 
 In our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise . 
 I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate . 
 I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them . 
 There is a limit to how useful that is . 
 I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South_Africa . 
 However , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , Cuba and China . 
 It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty . 
 Quite simply , I want us to be engaged with China . 
 I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers . 
 So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ? 
 It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not . 
 I utterly reject this ! 
 If the report is adopted in plenary session , then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in_order_to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme . 
 One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture ? 
 Furthermore , he considers that " genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is affixed to or accompanies the additive " . 
 We want EQUAL to go ahead . 
 I also stressed the need for prevention . 
 Lieneman report ( A5-0027 / 2000 ) 
 However , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the Member States for decision . 
 However , I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used . 
 However the Union should be seeking , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater . 
 Consequently , if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future , in light of the economic and employment changes taking place , as_well_as the requirements of society , modernisation is absolutely essential . 
 ( The sitting was suspended at 1.55_p.m. and resumed at 3_p.m. ) 
 Mr President , I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home . 
 But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies . 
 What happens in another part of the world affects us . 
 I also want to mention the death penalty . 
 I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion . 
 There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no_longer given any attention . 
 The debate is closed . 
 The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned . 
 Secondly , the European Union stands to gain , in my view , by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council . 
 Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well . 
 Not Mr Denkta º , not something with no legal existence , the ' Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' , but the Turkish 
 The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port . 
 In view of the seriousness of such situations , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at_least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field . 
 This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April . 
 Mr President , I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer . 
 He has created a separate currency , a judicial body ... 
 Yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union . 
 Firstly , is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners ? 
 This is of_course extremely important for the Community of Fifteen . 
 This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights . 
 Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ? 
 This question also crops up during the debate on the degree of sovereignty which the nation states can and should transfer to the institutions of the European Union . 
 I simply did not see any point in qualifying it or , generally , in associating my way of thinking with a specific continent . 
 I refer to the civil society . 
 Specifically , that means that one of the first jobs is to transfer certain social solidarity tasks to local authorities and non-profit-making or public-sector organisations . 
 This genuine solidarity between citizens , social groups , communities and regions is the best basis for solidarity which can not be dispensed by a single entity , i.e. the state . 
 However , one can also imagine the unfortunate situation in which there is no UN mandate and yet intervention is in the interest of the whole of Europe and human civilisation as we know it . 
 On the contrary , Europe should , at_long_last , get its own act together and serve as an example which others may , but are not obliged to , follow . 
 A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to . 
 Mr President , what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific . 
 Ideally the European Parliament ' s representatives should be able to support Cuba ' s intent at those proceedings , as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing . 
 I do not have very long in which to speak , and I really only want to take up two questions . 
 Finally , I would refer to the South_Africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon . 
 Peace has broken out , and we can now look forward to cooperation with South_Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought_to have underpinned the whole business from the start . 
 Thank you , Commissioner . 
 The vote will take place tomorrow at 12_p.m . 
 This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region . 
 Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status . 
 In the eyes of the Albanian minority , the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo ' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme . 
 It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia , and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report . 
 Mr President , the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe , 
 I just have one more request . 
 Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved , which are far from matching Parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology . 
 That is a more reasonable system . 
 That is not correct . 
 To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and , by realigning old procedures with the new situation , we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past . 
 The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year . 
 That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits . 
 The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met . 
 He has done really good work in a very short time . 
 The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed . 
 Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences . 
 The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character , accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others . 
 I would also like to make a more general point . 
 Not so long_ago we were dealing with one_or_more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session . 
 However , there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved . 
 Mr President , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money . 
 After all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting . 
 The framework decision will , however , have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future . 
 The issue of UCITS may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield . 
 Moving on now , then , to the point where there is ( or , I hope , was ) a lack of agreement , namely OTC derivatives . 
 They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors . 
 Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather_than improving the overall system for Europe . 
 The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses . 
 As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control , the risks are all the more obvious . 
 Mr President , there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance . 
 We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward . 
 The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro . 
 In practice , access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments . 
 As far as the second proposal is concerned , I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments . 
 The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities , better known as ISD , is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion . 
 Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States 
 The content of my amendment is , in fact , echoed in Amendment No_43 , which also stipulates this condition of accrual . 
 Hence , it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted . 
 As_for videoconferencing , more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded . 
 Madam President , Amendments Nos 22 and 24 refer to the fact that the MEDA programme still applies to Cyprus and Malta . 
 If the movers of the motion are in agreement with this , then I would recommend that the House votes on it and adopts it . 
 I would ask you to use the full name of our Group . 
 We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages , but have not been able to check all of these , and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type . 
 ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) 
 President . 
 I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport . 
 Di Pietro report ( A5-0019 / 2000 ) 
 What is more , the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control . 
 The cooperation agreement with South_Africa is a prime example . 
 50_% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest . 
 The Lomé Convention , on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African , Caribbean and Pacific countries rests , is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations . 
 Through the agreement , the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty . 
 If it is a personal statement , would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate , at which stage I would be happy to call you ? 
 She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations , observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy , Mr Vidal-Quadras . 
 Commissioner Liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention . 
 I believe that the European Union and the Commission must ask the Council and the Member States to consider the procedures for implementing these directives in the different States as well . 
 The Commission ' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point . 
 EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer . 
 I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands . 
 The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions : 
 B5-0141 / 2000 by Mr Schori and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the situation in Kosovo ; 
 Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5_000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ? 
 In this sense , I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou ' s proposals . 
 The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many . 
 We must , some time soon , find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously . 
 We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past . 
 It must form the basis for our partners' political will . 
 It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days . 
 This is an important point , as several speakers have suggested . 
 The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather_than on verifiable statistical data . 
 Europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia , the Far East and America . 
 We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of European integration . 
 I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in_order_to develop a tourist sector . 
 We greatly welcome it , just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on , the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European_Commission . 
 If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe . 
 But we must support our tourism ! 
 The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community . 
 We should focus exclusively on all the tensions at work here , leaving no stone unturned . 
 I think we all acknowledge the economic , social and environmental importance of tourism in today ' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment . 
 I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism . 
 This will dramatically change the way it operates . 
 We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies . 
 I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up . 
 Mr President , I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No_5 of the Swoboda report . 
 Mr President , the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union . 
 The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them , in September 1999 and are , in any case , still available . 
 I would therefore ask you , Commissioner , to help me in my task as a new Member . 
 I would like more information on this , because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services . 
 Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect . 
 I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity . 
 The Commission should not , for_example , take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to , as some have suggested , as low as 50 grammes . 
 It is already employed widely in the transport sector . 
 The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract . 
 Others believe that it is not so bad after all , if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation . 
 " 
 It is time to share the Basque_Country , Spain and Europe . 
 As_for the other problems , we can talk about these . 
 The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European_Commission . 
 I would , however , remind you , and this is my final point , that the Commission is not the only Community institution . 
 Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in_line_with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years . 
 That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process . 
 Madam President , we admire Mr Kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism . 
 Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction . 
 As far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan . 
 Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened . 
 I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at_least four European Councils , those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency . 
 I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia . 
 In the current situation , we should say to the Russians " If you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia " . 
 This is not because we are against European defence , but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound , democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs . 
 We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community . 
 Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who , like us , hope to mediate between two opposing parties ? 
 This has not just happened . 
 Of_course we recognise the role of the Security Council , as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state , in maintaining international peace and security . 
 What about the infrastructures ? 
 And finally , can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development . 
 I can tell you , and you know , that prevention capabilities exist already in the Union . 
 I have just been writing a report before I came to this job , and writing a very good report , just to respond to my honourable friend , on policing in part of my own country . 
 What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing . 
 But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon . 
 I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia 
 There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers , sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2_% of the directors and managers are women . 
 ( Applause ) 
 I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words . 
 We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole . 
 Binding quotas also require reliable statistics and must not be excluded from any sector of society . 
 Inevitably , we should like , for the same reasons of power politics , to be allowed to have this debate more_or_less to ourselves . 
 The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures . 
 I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish . 
 Women are no homogenous collective . 
 Women have different individual needs and interests . 
 Women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under-represented within political , economic and social fields . 
 Not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste . 
 It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance . 
 Like Mrs Van Lancker , I am a product of such a measure . 
 The debate is a deeply political one . 
 Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died , we do know that around 80_000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300_000 have lost their homes and crops . 
 In 1984 , tax revenue from top earners actually rose from 17.6_% , the level it was at in 1980 , to 25.6_% . 
 Mr President , like many others , I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report . 
 I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach , the European Union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted . 
 The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data . 
 In conjunction with these changes , Amendment No_5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly . 
 A Community framework for the collation of this data adds some structure and improves accessibility for the purpose of scientific evaluation . 
 I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States . 
 Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984 , then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland . 
 This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually , however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice . 
 They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species . 
 The common fisheries policy is not working . 
 Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded . 
 Therefore , as a child of the coast , I have always followed North Sea happenings with fervent interest . 
 We still have a considerable diversity of species in the water and on land . 
 One can quote from the communication . 
 I recommend the report to the House . 
 I would like to touch briefly on these amendments . 
 This particularly applies , however , to our own coastal waters . 
 This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy . 
 The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention . 
 The debate is closed . 
 Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel . 
 Firstly , anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel . 
 Therefore , because it is not an easy and simple issue , we have to be cautious and we have to be careful . 
 It is therefore essential to contain this disease and prevent it spreading to all the aquacultural establishments in the various Member Sates of the European Union . 
 We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish . 
 The Commission ' s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines , but it is important to point out that so_far , no vaccine has actually been found . 
 Why do we think that investment should not be used as an instrument for managing demand but should rather be practised for its own sake ? 
 It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities . 
 Even the rise in oil prices did not cause an increase in inflation or halt this economic expansion , as might have been expected . 
 Human resources mean education , training and reform of the Welfare State in_order_to deal , in particular , with the problem of an ageing society . 
 I would encourage him to include issues such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as_well_as matters relating to the functioning of our institutions , in this reform . 
 Madam President , today's debate is welcome , necessary and timely . 
 Why ? 
 Your ultra-liberal headlong rush is thus surely not the solution to social problems , precariousness or employment problems faced by tens of millions of European citizens . 
 It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed . 
 I believe that the EU ' s prime_ministers ought_to study the Danish example when they meet for their tête-à-tête on the economy in Lisbon . 
 My second question is about the Employment Summit . 
 Only in this way will it be able to match the degree of seriousness with which the presidency is preparing this Special Summit . 
 The fact that the EU lags so_far behind the United_States with regard to research , job creation and the development of new technology gives pause for thought . 
 The European Social Fund and national governments must continue to finance drug rehabilitation programmes , to promote higher standards of adult literacy and to work against early school-leaving . 
 A number of Member States with high economic growth are facing an overstrained labour market and rising inflation . 
 But on the other hand , the sound rule of macro-economics should not be misused by pinning it down too much . 
 This should not happen . 
 Mr President , Prime_Minister Guterres has been most convincing . 
 Because so_far the debate on the information society has completely ignored the fact that only an elite with good technical training benefits from it ! 
 Mr President , I think it is extremely commendable that the Portuguese programme places such emphasis upon combating unemployment and that the objective is to banish all unemployment . 
 Education is to be put in order , a fiscal policy devised and venture capital arranged . In fact , everything possible is to be done to provide the innovators with everything on a plate . 
 One sees references , albeit only in chapter headings , to the Europe of innovation and knowledge , structural reforms , competitiveness , the European social model , employment , social cohesion , macroeconomic policies and sustainable growth . 
 That really is a brave decision , because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table , which is something nobody likes . 
 One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside . 
 But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation . 
 To an increasingly aged or ageing population , to a population which , despite everything , is still poor , and to a population which is becoming , alas , less and less well educated . 
 We must now define more clearly , within the context of competition and the information society , the principal public service roles of tomorrow as applicable to public undertakings and to private companies in this sector . 
 We must take a qualitative step forwards and move on from framework programmes to a European research area and a common research policy . 
 Finally , I want to mention a question on which there have been , and remain , a variety of views . 
 Therefore the Commission does not support it . 
 For these and other reasons , Europe's citizens rightly expect the Community to support actions to conserve and sustainably manage tropical forests . 
 The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
 I would therefore like to assure everyone that this is why it is sensible to opt for a system in which indirect costs are somehow absorbed in port dues . 
 For these reasons support our ' no-special-fee ' system . 
 I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and , in particular , Parliament . 
 Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , congratulations on your report . 
 The question is , of_course , raised as_to_whether rules can have an adverse effect on smaller vessels . 
 Now Europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks . 
 Mr President , Madam Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , safety on our roads is of great concern to us all . 
 The Council ' s common position will improve road safety considerably , and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible . 
 It is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long . 
 In fact , several States already apply this type of inspection , the so-called ' roadside inspections' , in the manner laid down in the directive , that is , in a somewhat unexpected manner . 
 Today , you have before you an analytical , very comprehensive document , which is how the five-year plan should be . 
 If you want to bring about the great turning point you mentioned , Mr President of the Commission , then you had better make a start on this damn quickly . 
 That is not how we envisage Europe to be ! 
 You also made the point then , that you intend to gauge the success of your work from the level of turnout at the European elections in 2004 . 
 It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and , frankly , the developing world has little so_far to thank the WTO for . 
 I also welcome the ongoing commitment to the Galileo project and the review of the TENs strategy , especially with its highlight on the railway sector , a sector which we believe to be very important indeed . 
 Can I take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the five-year strategic plan . 
 This debate has clearly revealed the vital importance of our cooperation . 
 These are the plans for a great European Union , plans with a specific objective . 
 Mr President , I put an extremely topical and extremely precise question to the President of the Commission about his view of the relationship between freedom of expression and responsibility for cooperating loyally with the institutions . 
 It is a question which is being debated everywhere in Europe at the moment , and we should be extremely interested to hear his view . 
 Should we assent to other legislation ? 
 We are getting one , two and a half years after the directive has entered into force . 
 The amendments that came before the Environment Committee , with the exception of the few that were passed , were wrecking amendments . 
 What is there to stop us , in future , describing oil to which palm oil has been added as olive oil ? 
 We have therefore tabled a motion to reject the Council ' s common position . 
 This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence , but , ladies and gentlemen , if you give up a specific definition of chocolate , then at_least do so clearly and openly . 
 We are linked by the Lomé convention and by the convention on commodities which the European Union has signed , with reference to cocoa . 
 On the other hand , it represents a cause for concern among small specialist chocolate-makers and also developing countries which are cocoa producers , whose compensation is being seriously considered . 
 In this area there is no need for harmonisation at EU level . Instead , the previous system can be retained . 
 Any future investigation of the effects of the present directive upon developing countries' exports ought therefore also to include both cocoa and shea nuts . 
 No matter nowadays what the consumer wants , what the consumer ' s preferences are , no matter the fact that public opinion wants ever greater transparency ! 
 And let us , most especially , support our rapporteur , Mr Lannoye . 
 In short , chocolate is a dividing factor and the divisions are neither ideological nor even national , whatever some parties might think . 
 Mr President , rules make sense if their purpose is to protect people against the power of money , against health risks and against poverty . 
 If I could share one brief historical fact with the House concerning my own country : the first mention of solid chocolate being sold in the UK was in 1657 when a Frenchman opened a shop in London . 
 Through the common position , the free movement of cocoa and chocolate products was introduced , but with strict conditions governing production and consumer information . 
 Mr President , we all have the right to express our opinions in this House and in a democracy . 
 There are basically two reasons . 
 The other reason has to do with comitology . 
 The department of French Guyana , in particular , is almost entirely covered by this type of vegetation . 
 In the jungle of maritime transport , such behaviour is , unfortunately , frequently encountered . 
 These are the reasons why , ladies and gentlemen , I supported the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles today . 
 The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding . 
 The assets we have as Europeans in the form of cultural differences are easier to maintain and to accept if citizens know that they can claim their rights throughout the Union . 
 Enlargement of the Union without guaranteed rights could even turn into a fiasco and delay our economic development . 
 The Charter must be binding and embrace the European institutions . 
 There is , for_example , the right of organisation and association which can be extended to the right of free negotiations on working conditions and the right of conducting collective action . 
 This is a misconception in my view . 
 Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions . 
 It will depend on whether the work is useful and can be incorporated into the Treaties . 
 We want more than this . 
 Firstly , if we have put together such a unique body only to codify the existing law to the letter , then I believe it was not worth planning this new body . 
 It is high time that we tackled these shortcomings in the protection of fundamental rights . 
 At the same time , the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents a great opportunity for Europe . 
 We feel that the Intergovernmental Conference is our opportunity to resolve this question , and this opportunity must not be passed up . 
 Mr President , I should like to express my substantial agreement with the point just made by Mr Napolitano . 
 The big question is not whether we need such a Charter but what status it should have . 
 So the Charter must fill in any gaps in existing rights , and it must be binding on the institutions of the European Union . 
 Seen in this light , it is time for all of us to call for constructive work to commence on our own Charter . 
 Families are firmly connected with the European notion of society . 
 We can not run the risk that when this charter comes into force a new area of legal uncertainty will be created . 
 It is a case , then , of introducing qualified majority where we think it necessary , and leaving unanimous decisions where they are preferable . 
 That is the second principle . 
 Regarding direct taxation , we propose the qualified majority in_order_to coordinate the campaign against fraud and tax evasion and in_order_to ensure proper handling of situations involving the legislations of several Member States . 
 In so doing we are seeking to achieve coherence . 
 I wish him well in this area because it is an area in which we need a breakthrough . 
 This is why we recommend an extremely thorough , and I might almost say clinical analysis of these matters , in the interests of the internal market . 
 In the light of this , may I conclude that the Commissioner does not wish to comply with the Presidency ' s note on these proposals ? 
 I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that , when the campaign is decentralised , information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of_course . 
 The key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established . 
 Question No_45 by ( H-0208 / 00 ) : 
 What is the Commission's assessment of the above-mentioned imbalances between these two types of agreement ? 
 I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer . 
 So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority . 
 It must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority . 
 However , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition . 
 The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event . 
 Finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction . 
 Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for_ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment . 
 This , I thought , is no_longer permissible , certainly not at the moment . 
 I shall , I assure you , Mr Heaton-Harris , pay particular attention to the show of hands . 
 In voting against this report , we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic . 
 We are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive . 
 Clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European_Commission . 
 But , in my opinion , it is not sufficient simply to combat these consequences . We should also seek solutions and proposals which will give the best possible assurance that events such as this do not recur . 
 In the case of cars , we all know that , after four years , they have to undergo a technical inspection every year . 
 We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety . 
 But this is not in place . 
 Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless_of all the port charges . 
 Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TÜV ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies . 
 At this testing time , demonstrating their efficiency , the public services have reminded everybody how essential they are to the life of our society . 
 I would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their troubles are not yet over . 
 Our priority , as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States . 
 There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters . 
 The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls . 
 In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site . 
 This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2_% . 
 Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is . 
 That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular . 
 The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " Yes to Work " and " Back to Work " . 
 We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority . 
 Therefore , today ' s debate on the discharge of the 1997 budget signals the end of a long process . 
 Within a_few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team . 
 I would like to end on the following point . 
 Nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report . 
 Therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk . 
 You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts ! 
 Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European_Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be . 
 We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented . 
 The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments . 
 This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured . 
 Of_course Austria is a sovereign nation and of_course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State . 
 History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided . 
 Today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech . 
 Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility . 
 What establishes a recognised minority ? 
 The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once_and_for_all . 
 We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve . 
 If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is . 
 The other area of conflict is more difficult . 
 This opinion is positive about the convening of the IGC and yet critical , as it would inevitably have to be , about the substance of this agenda . 
 The important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever_since I accepted the position of Commissioner . 
 Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully . 
 In the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No_22 , that possibility is contemplated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security . 
 On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point . 
 Finally , and this follows on from what I have just said , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made . 
 Of all people , it is the Albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a_little_more idea as_to what is in store for them . 
 As far as the financial framework is concerned , had the Council significantly reduced its original package it would have come close to jeopardising the continued existence of the programme . 
 Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme . 
 This will involve , for_example , disposing of more than 32 million lots_of used oil , removing break fluid , etc . 
 Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers ! 
 It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position , whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough . 
 Moreover , the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006 , when a good number of the existing vehicles will no_longer be on the market . 
 This can not be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment . 
 Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy . 
 They have our full support . 
 Finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life . 
 In all other areas , I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion . 
 Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning . 
 You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme . 
 You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health . 
 Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens . 
 The Commission gives no soul to Europe . 
 Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at_least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ? 
 Mr President , the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts . 
 The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years . 
 However , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in_order_to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives . 
 However , before labelling we need clear rules . 
 One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned . 
 Mr President , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets . 
 When will you make it compulsory ? 
 In this it said that in a_few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances . 
 Therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete . 
 The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected . 
 In the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium . 
 The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars : that of the rule of law . 
 I should just like to point out once_again that the joint text still holds good . 
 I am also saying this as a former environment minister . 
 Will it discuss the matter ? Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission ? 
 It is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious . 
 We need to look very carefully at those . 
 Mr President , Commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading . 
 The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful claimants , revenue or benefits , etc . It is thus impossible to bring all States into line . 
 If no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach . 
 We explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever . 
 Once_again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary_of_State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground . 
 The topic touches the very core of the European Union . 
 I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions . 
 We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote . 
 The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention . 
 I worked for many years on the South_African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open , European-style , pluralistic democratic society . 
 As I said at the beginning , the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed . 
 Not only are they countries which the European Union needs , but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union . 
 This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem . 
 Mr President , Mrs Karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one , and I would not wish to conceal that fact . 
 Mr President , Mr Alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues . 
 There are not only " good guys " in this story . 
 I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything , but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers . 
 Secondly , as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ? 
 The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities , as furthermore , did the President of the European Parliament , when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council . 
 It was not by chance that , shortly after it came to power , the Communist dictatorship shredded and then eradicated the fabric of civil society as quickly as possible . 
 The way in which society structures itself can not , of_course , be imposed from on high . 
 One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately . 
 So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999 . The rapporteur , Mr Corrie , has already done so most expertly . 
 By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool , in the hands of technocrats , for imposing new sets of conditions , the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty . 
 In a wider context , the priorities , as I see it , are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development , as_well_as control of fraud and corruption . 
 There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture . 
 What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met ? 
 We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues , a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack , Mr Lagendijk and others . 
 It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised . 
 However , we are unable to agree to the text of the report , although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt , for several reasons . 
 I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies , in terms of both finance and management . 
 Note that sensitive words like ' redundancy ' are not used . Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights . 
 Rationalised management and improved profits should , in my view , serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost , and any financial benefits should follow . 
 These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question . 
 We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature . 
 This is a sign of hope , the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia . 
 The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness . 
 This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm . 
 B5-0167 / 2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party , 
 The existing postal companies no_longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors . 
 Whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse . 
 The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal . 
 In fact , the Commission desires this reform in_order_to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world . 
 In short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ? 
 Today , we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities . 
 Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg . 
 You know the French proverb , ' Nothing for nothing ' . 
 What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ? 
 How , with credibility , are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments ? 
 My second question concerns the following matter . Some weeks ago , you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media , whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters . 
 My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light . 
 At the beginning of this century , the French government sent out a beacon , a bombshell on the equality of opportunity policy front . 
 We still do not have a female president but , on the other hand , we have a queen , and that must no doubt , in certain contexts , amount to the same thing . 
 I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women , specifically because it is characterised by flat , rather_than hierarchical , structures . 
 If this is true , and it is , any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point . 
 Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training ? 
 Indeed , Minister , we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract . 
 The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia , Central America and the Caribbean . 
 These experts were most emphatic about how important it is to take investment-related measures and to employ demand-orientated instruments . 
 When I read the report and see the picture of the EU ' s economy that is described there , I think it is quite a worrying picture . 
 In our opinion , the Union ' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity , not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs . 
 Mr President , Commissioner , to be able to adopt a credible fisheries policy , the Commission needs comprehensive and reliable data on fish stocks and fisheries fleets at its disposal . 
 I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development . 
 This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon , causing death . 
 The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms . 
 The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age . 
 Mr President , Mr Fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen . 
 As I have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika . 
 A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation . 
 A_lot_of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep . 
 With regard to Amendment No_6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee . 
 Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks . 
 Finally , we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks , as_well_as to scientific research work in_order_to avoid and eliminate damage . 
 According_to our resolution , the polluter ' s liability must extend to fishing , fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses . 
 This may be very concentrated and create many problems , but it is industry which is responsible for 60_% of pollution . 
 Israel can be certain that Europe is in favour of its security and stability , but it can not ask us to be party to such grave violations . 
 But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions . 
 It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in_order_to ensure that the Erika was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast . 
 Coordination is natural in many sectors - within the framework of the tasks of the Union also - to avoid overlapping , but healthy , honest competition is still more important than coordination , including in many non-commercial sectors . 
 We must not build a Europe of the haves and the have-nots . 
 I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area . 
 When 13-year-old school children play on the computer after school at restructuring their parents' share portfolios , then this has more to do with toy casinos than with responsibility . 
 Mr President , Prime_Minister , President of the Commission , the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious programme for the Special Summit . 
 Nevertheless , you will have to have the means at your disposal , means which , I fear , you are somewhat lacking at present . 
 Mr President-in-Office , your proposal is a very ambitious one , although we know that its implementation does not depend on you , but on the 15 Member States . 
 Europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on . 
 This rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches , severely damaging the environment and marine life . 
 In this respect , I believe that the legislation intended by this directive covers various aspects relating to the delivery of waste to ports . 
 I would ask for support for a more positive position , supplemented - I insist - with Amendment No_16 by Mr Sterckx , which would provide us with the necessary guarantees . 
 That would not make any sense . 
 Mr President of the Commission , I would just like to pick up again on your expression " decisive year " . 
 One day , the voters will echo the remark of the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen ' s tale , ' The Emperor ' s New Clothes' , ' Yes , but he is not wearing anything ' . 
 The first chapter of the work programme is entitled : " Europe , its neighbours and the world " and rightly so . 
 Mr President , the previous Commission worked under the motto " do less in_order_to do better " , as_opposed_to the supposedly active approach of the Delors Commission . 
 We must bear in mind that in future , more must be done to uphold the rights of the Member States . 
 You said in your speech that you prefer to make mistakes rather_than fail to act . 
 Quite simply because the WTO , according_to the Marrakech model , does not permit this , or permits it only with extreme difficulty . 
 We know that the cost of the fats capable of replacing cocoa is much less . 
 What makes defending cocoa-producing countries an ideological matter , I ask you ? 
 I value the attempts made by Mr Lannoye to keep these negative developments within bounds , but it would be better still to continue to offer full protection against the processing of other products and cocoa butter . 
 We may agree with something or we may not . 
 In the last week of February , 39 instances of illegal degassing were identified in the vicinity of the wreck of the Erika alone . 
 I want to warn against joining the Council of Europe ' s convention , especially if this step were not to be combined with a binding Charter . 
 The purpose of the charter is to incorporate these fundamental rights in the European institutions and European policy . 
 Being European is a positive thing . It adds to what we already have as national citizens . 
 In my view , there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject . 
 Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country . 
 This is not a plus , but a minus . 
 At the same time , however , this means that we must confine ourselves to the traditional fundamental rights and avoid extending the scope to social and economic fundamental rights , which are not legally enforceable at European level . 
 Once_again , the Commission would like to make four key points quite clear to Parliament . 
 But this first principle gives rise to a second , which is as follows : qualified majority to enable measures to be adopted which are more directly linked to the proper operation of the internal market .
